# huwindty üå¨Ô∏è

I wanted to use [Windty](https://github.com/distantcam/windty/) for my next [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) project before I realised I need more than just a single page with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). So I kept the good work and added more.

## What was added
### Continuous Integration
- Publication to github pages
- Deployment to stand alone server via ssh (manual action)
- Lighthouse checks on key pages for each PR to keep the triple üíØ
### Styles
- Tailwind css are processed directly by 11ty
### Navigation
- Navigation menu is directly generated from page structure
### Site output
- Handle markdown with style
- Process images to make them responsive
### Content Managment System
- Installed Decap CMS with content flow
- Possibility to use Sveltia CMS with the same config
### Documentation
- Documentation comes with the package as an example
- Explains how features are developped


## What is still missing
- better SEO metadata
- documentation on the CMS
- maybe a nicer design
